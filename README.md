# Cheter IDE
(a fork of Cheter by [@abhay-s](https://github.com/abhay-s)

Cheter IDE is a new Electron-based code editor that allows you to code on the fly with little to no usage of storage, processing power, and other critical resources.
Cheter keeps all the dependencies on your computer so you don't have to worry about the app requiring any networking at all (except for updates, of course).


Cheter is planned to have the following amazing features added:
```
- syntax highlighting (release date: tbd)
- dark theme (release date: tbd)
- themes in general (release date: tbd)
- save to file (release date: ASAP)
- git integration (release date: tbd)
- And More!
```

# Building & Installing
Cheter is super easy to install and build. Simply run the following command in Node.JS while "cd\[ed\]" into the repo to get Cheter up and running. Simply do:
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

If you prefer not to build, we have compiled EXEs, APPs, and more accessible via the releases page [here](https://github.com/KnoxDevTeam/Cheter-IDE/releases/latest).
